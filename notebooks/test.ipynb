However, its distributed nature presents problems of systemic and statistical heterogeneity that generate training instability, thus requiring adaptive and dynamic solutions. Therefore, this paper presents the community with a new way to address these problems using language model agents. We demonstrate the reasons why LM agents should be used in FL, their advantages, and research opportunities. We also conduct two experiments to demonstrate the potential of a simple implementation and how it can be enhanced through sophisticated agent techniques.\",\n",

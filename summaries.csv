UrbanKAgents,"Urban knowledge graph has recently worked as an emerging building block to distill critical knowledge from multi-sourced urban data for diverse urban application scenarios. Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama 2 and Llama 3 family, we obtain UrbanKGC agent family, consisting of UrbanKGent-7/8/13B version. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent family can not only significantly outperform 31 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10% with approximately 20 times lower cost. Compared with the existing benchmark, the UrbanKGent family could help construct an UrbanKG with hundreds of times richer relationships using only one-fifth of the data."
Knowledge Management for Automobile Failure Analysis Using Graph RAG,"This paper presents a knowledge management system for automobile failure analysis using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis."
Mobility LLM,"Location-based services (LBS) have accumulated extensive human mobility data on diverse behaviors through check-in sequences. These sequences offer valuable insights into users’ intentions and preferences. Yet, existing models analyzing check-in sequences fail to consider the semantics contained in these sequences, which closely reflect human visiting intentions and travel preferences, leading to an incomplete comprehension. Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users’ travel preferences. These components enhance the model’s ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the effectiveness of Mobility-LLM in advancing our understanding of human mobility data within LBS contexts."
Adaptive and Parallel Split Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing,"Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge–cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an adaptive split FL scheme for VEC (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on nonindependent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles’ mobility"
FedSL: Federated split learning on distributed sequential data in recurrent neural networks,"Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are privacy-preserving Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that enable training ML models over data distributed among clients without requiring direct access to their raw data. Existing FL and SL approaches work on horizontally or vertically partitioned data and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data where segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across clients. In this paper, we propose a novel federated split learning framework, FedSL, to train models on distributed sequential data. The most common ML models to train on sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since the proposed framework is privacy preserving, segments of multiple-segment sequential data cannot be shared between clients or between clients and server. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. A RNN is split into sub-networks, and each sub-network is trained on one client containing single segments of multiple-segment training sequences. During local training, the sub-networks on different clients communicate with each other to capture latent dependencies between consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data on different clients, but without sharing raw data or complete model parameters. After training local sub-networks with local sequential data segments, all clients send their sub-networks to a federated server where sub-networks are aggregated to generate a global model. The experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully trains models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds."
SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning,"Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two popular distributed machine learning approaches. Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures is further evaluated under extended experimental settings."
Federated Learning and Meta Learning: Approaches Applications and Directions,"Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the field of machine learning (ML) to address resource management, interference management, autonomy, and decision-making in wireless networks. Traditional ML approaches rely on centralized methods, where data is collected at a central server for training. However, this approach poses a challenge in terms of preserving the data privacy of devices. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution that allows edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without compromising data privacy. In FL, local datasets are not shared, and the focus is on learning a global model for a specific task involving all devices. However, FL has limitations when it comes to adapting the model to devices with different data distributions. In such cases, meta learning is considered, as it enables the adaptation of learning models to different data distributions using only a few data samples. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive review of FL, meta learning, and federated meta learning (FedMeta). Unlike other tutorial papers, our objective is to explore how FL, meta learning, and FedMeta methodologies can be designed, optimized, and evolved, and their applications over wireless networks. We also analyze the relationships among these learning algorithms and examine their advantages and disadvantages in real-world applications."
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks,"We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies."
MGSTA: Meta Learning Based Graph Convolutional Stacked Temporal Attention Neural Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting,"Recently, numerous deep learning-based methodologies have been applied to the domain of traffic flow forecasting, showcasing a significant enhancement in predictive accuracy when compared to the conventional statistical approaches. However, a critical reexamination of traffic flow prediction from the perspective of regional traffic diversity reveals that prevailing spatio-temporal traffic networks tend to neglect the heterogeneity of urban traffic patterns. The spatio-temporal correlations within urban regions intricately links to regional characteristic data (such as points of interests,i.e., POIs and road network density), which in turn influence the variations in traffic flow across diverse urban areas. In light of this, we propose a meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network (MGSTA). Different from the mainstream sptio-temporal traffic network that iteratively optimize the model parameters by gradient descent after their generation. The parameters of the proposed spatio-temporal module are generated by a series of meta-learning layers, which are specifically designed for learning these meta characteristic data. Experiments on multiple datasets have proved the superior performance of the proposed model and the substantial improvements brought by this new idea to the spatio-temporal feature learning capabilities of the traffic prediction model."
RDIwS: An Efficient Beamforming-Based Method for UAV Detection and Classification,"The detection and classification of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are disturbing challenges within contemporary radar systems, wherein the physical characteristics of UAVs, including their size and radar cross section (RCS), exert a substantial influence on radar’s detection capabilities. Smaller UAVs, characterized by reduced RCS values, often escape radar detection. In response to these challenges, this study introduces an efficient radar signal processing technique based on beamforming, termed range–Doppler integration while steering (RDIwS). RDIwS significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) associated with UAVs, resulting in an increased detection probability and classification accuracy for these UAVs. Importantly, the RDIwS approach demonstrates superior performance to traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) methods and established beamforming-based techniques, showcasing its potential to significantly advance UAV detection and classification across various operational contexts. For four targets located at different angles and distances scenario, and at −30 dB SNR and false alarm probability of 10−5 , the RDIwS beamforming-based method achieved a detection probability of 75% compared to 5% for steering-only beamforming, and no detection for MIMO radar case."
Experimental Demonstration of Distributed Beamforming on Two Flying Mini-Drones,"Combing distributed small wireless systems on mobile platforms such as swarm airborne mini-drones has been explored recently. Localization and synchronization of the mobile drones are the main challenges limiting its practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to circumvent this limits by considering the drones as relay nodes, where the received signals are modulated to different frequencies and then re-transmitted to the final receiver for demodulation and beamforming. Real-time adaptive beamformer algorithm is used to compensate for the phase delay difference among drone elements in RF circuitry and in propagation paths caused by different drone elements positions. A beamforming array based on two-drones uses to demonstrate this concept. Improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) has been experimentally demonstrated with such beamforming approach. The proposed beamforming system architecture is expected to extend to a large of number distributed mini-drones for future wireless sensing and communication systems."
Multi-Beam Beamforming-Based ML Algorithm to Optimize the Routing of Drone Swarms,"The advancement of wireless networking has significantly enhanced beamforming capabilities in Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (AUAS). This paper presents a simple and efficient classical algorithm to route a collection of AUAS or drone swarms extending our previous work on AUAS. The algorithm is based on the sparse factorization of frequency Vandermonde matrices that correspond to each drone, and its entries are determined through spatiotemporal data of drones in the AUAS. The algorithm relies on multibeam beamforming, making it suitable for large-scale AUAS networking in wireless communications. We show a reduction in the arithmetic and time complexities of the algorithm through theoretical and numerical results. Finally, we also present an ML-based AUAS routing algorithm using the classical AUAS algorithm and feed-forward neural networks. We compare the beamformed signals of the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm with the ground truth signals to minimize the error between them. The numerical error results show that the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm enhances the accuracy of the routing. This error, along with the numerical and theoretical results for over 100 drones, provides the basis for the scalability of the proposed ML-based AUAS algorithms for large-scale deployments."
A Survey on Federated Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we describe the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications. Besides, we discuss the existing challenges and potential future research directions for FL-based ITS."
Decentralized and Distributed Learning for AIoT: A Comprehensive Review Emerging Challenges and Opportunities,"The advent of the Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things (AIoT) has sparked a revolution in the deployment of intelligent systems, driving the need for innovative data processing techniques. Due to escalating data privacy concerns and the immense volume of data produced by IoT devices, decentralized and distributed learning methods that are rapidly replacing traditional centralized learning play a pivotal role. As AIoT systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the accompanying computational and storage demands necessitate a departure from conventional paradigms towards more scalable, distributed, and decentralized architectures. This paper delves into the background of AIoT, with a particular focus on the evolution of distributed and decentralized learning mechanisms that operate without the need for centralized data collection, thus aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for enhanced data privacy. The various distributed and decentralized learning strategies are the focus of this paper that facilitate collaborative model training across multiple AIoT nodes, thereby not only improving the performance of the AIoT system but also mitigating the risks of data concentration. The review further explores the adaptability of AI algorithms in these distributed settings, assessing their potential to optimize system performance and learning efficacy. The paper concludes with some use cases and lessons learned for decentralized and distributed learning in various AIoT areas."
Split Federated Learning Empowered Vehicular Edge Intelligence: Adaptive Parellel Design and Future Directions,"To achieve ubiquitous intelligence in future vehicular networks, artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for extracting valuable insights from vehicular data to enhance AI-driven services. By integrating AI technologies into vehicular edge computing (VEC) platforms, which provide essential storage, computing, and network resources, vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) can be fully realized. Traditional centralized learning, as one of the enabling technologies for VEI, places significant strain on network bandwidth while also increasing latency and privacy concerns. Nowadays, distributed machine learning methods, such as federated learning (FL), split learning (SL), and split federated learning (SFL), are widely applied in vehicular networks to support VEI. However, these methods still face significant challenges due to the mobility and constrained resources inherent in vehicular networks. In this article, we first provide an over-view of the system architecture, performance metrics, and challenges associated with VEI design. Then, the adaptive design of SFL, namely adaptive split federated learning (ASFL) is introduced. The proposed ASFL scheme dynamically adapts the cut layer selection process and operates in parallel, optimizing both communication and computation efficiency while improving model performance under non-IID data distribution. Finally, we high-light future research directions to shed the light on the efficient design of SFL."

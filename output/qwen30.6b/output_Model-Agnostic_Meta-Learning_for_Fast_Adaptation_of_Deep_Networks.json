  "summary": "We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.",

The user provided a list of recommended conferences with their details, including acronyms, names, deadlines, locations, and links. Let me start by organizing the information.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned two main conferences: CMLDS 2026 and HPC Conference. I should list them clearly, making sure to include the acronyms, names, dates, locations, and links. Then, there are additional_info sections with two questions from Zhihu. I need to present these as well, but since the user's request is for the report, maybe just list the additional info as part of the conference details. Wait, the user's query is to write the report, so perhaps the additional_info should be included as a separate section. Let me check the example response. The user's example includes both conference details and additional info. So, I should structure the report with the main conferences first, then the additional info as a separate section.\n\nWait, the user's query is to write the report, so maybe the additional info should be included as a list. Let me make sure. The example response includes both conference details and additional info. So, in the report, after listing the main conferences, I can mention the additional info as a list. That way, the user can see all relevant information.\n\nNow, I need to format the report in Markdown. Start with the title, then the main conferences, each with their details, and then the additional info as a list. Make sure to use the correct acronyms, dates, and links. Also, check for any typos or formatting issues.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this keyword extraction plan. The user wants to extract conceptual keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to understand the task clearly. The core strategy is to differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. So, first, I should read the text carefully and identify the main themes.\n\nThe paper is about an algorithm for meta-learning, which is model-agnostic. The key terms here are \"meta-learning,\" \"model-agnostic,\" \"algorithm,\" \"gradient descent,\" \"few-shot,\" \"regression,\" \"policy gradient,\" \"neural network policies.\" But wait, the user mentioned to exclude specific keywords like \"stragglers\" or \"CIFAR-10,\" so those terms should be ignored. Let me check the example again. The example text includes terms like \"non-iid data,\" which are specific, so they should be excluded. The user's own example includes \"stragglers\" and \"CIFAR-10,\" so those are specific. So in the output, I need to list only the conceptual terms.\n\nNow, the plan should be step-by-step. First, read the text and identify the main ideas. Then, categorize the terms. For conceptual keywords, look for high-level terms like \"meta-learning,\" \"model-agnostic,\" \"algorithm,\" \"few-shot,\" \"regression,\" \"policy gradient,\" \"neural network policies.\" Specific terms like \"non-iid data\" and \"CIFAR-10\" should be excluded. Then, structure the plan to extract these terms. Make sure to mention the input and output clearly. Also, check if there are any other terms that might be considered, but based on the example, those are the ones to exclude. Finally, present the list of keywords in the output.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n**Input:** Academic text (e.g., \"We propose an algorithm for meta-learning...\").  \n**Output:** List of **Conceptual/Thematic Keywords** (excluding specific/technical terms).  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Read and Identify Core Themes**  \n1. **Identify High-Level Terms**:  \n   - \"Meta-learning\" (conceptual)  \n   - \"Model-agnostic\" (conceptual)  \n   - \"Algorithm\" (conceptual)  \n   - \"Gradient descent\" (technical)  \n   - \"Few-shot\" (conceptual)  \n   - \"Policy gradient\" (conceptual)  \n   - \"Neural network policies\" (conceptual)  \n\n2. **Filter Specific/Technical Terms**:  \n   - Exclude terms like \"stragglers,\" \"CIFAR-10,\" \"non-iid data,\" \"Adam optimizer,\" \"CIFAR-10 dataset.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Categorize and Extract Keywords**  \n1. **Categorize Terms**:  \n   - **Conceptual Keywords**: High-level terms that define research fields, paradigms, or broad areas (e.g., \"meta-learning,\" \"model-agnostic\").  \n   - **Technical Keywords**: Low-level terms that describe specific problems, datasets, or algorithms (e.g., \"non-iid data,\" \"Adam optimizer\").  \n\n2. **List Final Output**:  \n   - Example:  \n     ```\n     [Conceptual Keywords]  \n     - Meta-learning  \n     - Model-agnostic  \n     - Algorithm  \n     - Gradient descent  \n     - Few-shot  \n     - Policy gradient  \n     - Neural network policies  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalize and Present**  \n- Ensure the output is concise and reflects the core concepts of the text.  \n- Avoid any technical or specific terms that may be excluded.  \n\n**Example Output**:  \n```\n[Conceptual Keywords]  \n- Meta-learning  \n- Model-agnostic  \n- Algorithm  \n- Gradient descent  \n- Few-shot  \n- Policy gradient  \n- Neural network policies  \n```",
      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract conceptual keywords from the given paper summary. The task is to identify terms that are more likely to be conference or workshop keywords, not just paper details.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the text and identify all potential candidate terms. The text mentions \"meta-learning,\" \"model-agnostic,\" \"gradient descent,\" \"classification,\" \"regression,\" \"reinforcement learning,\" \"few-shot image classification,\" \"policy gradient,\" \"neural network policies,\" \"state-of-the-art,\" \"state-of-the-art performance,\" \"good results,\" \"accelerates fine-tuning,\" \"neural network policies.\"\n\nNow, applying the core test: Is the term a conference/workshop topic or just a paper detail? Let's go through each term.\n\n\"Meta-learning\" is a conference or workshop term, so it passes.\n\n\"Model-agnostic\" is a technical term, but it's part of the paper's context. However, the test is for conference-level topics. Since it's a technical term, maybe it's a paper detail. Wait, but the example in the previous step had terms like \"federated learning\" which are conference terms. So maybe \"model-agnostic\" is a paper detail. But the test is whether it's a conference or paper detail. If it's a conference term, then it passes. But if it's a paper detail, it fails. So I need to check if \"model-agnostic\" is a conference term. It's a technical term, so it's a paper detail. So it would fail.\n\nNext, \"gradient descent\" is part of the paper's approach, so it's a paper detail. So it fails.\n\n\"Classification\" and \"regression\" are learning tasks, which are part of the paper's context. But the test is for conference or paper details. So they pass? Wait, no. The test is if the term is a conference or workshop topic. If it's a paper detail, it fails. So \"classification\" and \"regression\" are paper details, so they fail. Similarly for \"reinforcement learning\" and \"policy gradient.\"\n\n\"Neural network policies\" is a technical term, so it's a paper detail. So it fails.\n\n\"State-of-the-art performance\" is a conference term, so it passes.\n\n\"Good results\" is a paper detail, so it fails.\n\n\"Accelerates fine-tuning\" is a paper detail, so it fails.\n\nSo the terms that pass are \"meta-learning,\" \"model-agnostic,\" \"state-of-the-art performance.\" Wait, but the example had \"federated learning\" and \"Networking,\" which are conference terms. So maybe \"model-agnostic\" is a conference term. But the test is whether it's a conference or paper detail. If it's a conference term, then it passes. Since it's a technical term, but the example includes \"federated learning\" which is a conference term, but \"model-agnostic\" is a paper detail. So maybe the test is whether the term is a conference or paper detail. If it's a conference term, it passes. If it's a paper detail, it fails. So \"model-agnostic\" is a paper detail, so it fails. Therefore, the correct terms are \"meta-learning\" and \"state-of-the-art performance.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, \"federated learning\" is a conference term, so it passes.

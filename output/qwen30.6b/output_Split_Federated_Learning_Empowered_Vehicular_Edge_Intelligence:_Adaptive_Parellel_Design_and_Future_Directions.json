  "summary": "To achieve ubiquitous intelligence in future vehicular networks, artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for extracting valuable insights from vehicular data to enhance AI-driven services. By integrating AI technologies into vehicular edge computing (VEC) platforms, which provide essential storage, computing, and network resources, vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) can be fully realized. Traditional centralized learning, as one of the enabling technologies for VEI, places significant strain on network bandwidth while also increasing latency and privacy concerns. Nowadays, distributed machine learning methods, such as federated learning (FL), split learning (SL), and split federated learning (SFL), are widely applied in vehicular networks to support VEI. However, these methods still face significant challenges due to the mobility and constrained resources inherent in vehicular networks. In this article, we first provide an over-view of the system architecture, performance metrics, and challenges associated with VEI design. Then, the adaptive design of SFL, namely adaptive split federated learning (ASFL) is introduced. The proposed ASFL scheme dynamically adapts the cut layer selection process and operates in parallel, optimizing both communication and computation efficiency while improving model performance under non-IID data distribution. Finally, we high-light future research directions to shed the light on the efficient design of SFL.",

  "final_decision": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a final report for the researcher based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the user's request. They want the report in Markdown format, with specific sections: recommended conferences, each including acronym, name, deadline, location, and a WikiCFP link. Also, there are additional info sections with snippets, titles, and links.\n\nFirst, I should structure the report. The user mentioned using Markdown, so I'll make sure to format each section properly. Let me check the data provided. There are two main conferences: ISIE and CYBER 2026. Each has their own details. For ISIE, the date is December 1, 2025, in Sydney, Australia. The topics are listed, and the additional info includes the IEEE link. For CYBER 2026, the date is September 27-10, 2026, in Barcelona, Spain. The topics are cybersecurity, forensics, nature-inspired cyber-defense, and social-inspired mobile systems. The additional info for CYBER 2026 includes the WiCyS link.\n\nI need to present both conferences clearly. Make sure each entry has all the required fields: acronym, name, deadline, location, and WikiCFP link. Also, include the additional info sections with the snippets, titles, and links. Let me verify the dates and locations again to ensure accuracy. For ISIE, the date is correct, and the location is Sydney. For CYBER 2026, the date is September 27-10, 2026, and location Barcelona. The links provided are correct, so I can use those. The topics for each conference are well-structured, so I can list them as separate bullet points.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this keyword extraction plan. The user wants to extract conceptual keywords from an academic text, specifically focusing on the first part of the provided paper summary. The paper is about integrating AI into vehicular edge computing (VEC) platforms to enhance AI-driven services, and the main challenge is the traditional centralized learning methods' issues like strain on network bandwidth and privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and output. The input is the academic text, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. The user mentioned that the plan should follow the core strategy of differentiating between conceptual and specific keywords. So, I need to split the text into these two categories.\n\nStarting with the input, the paper is about AI, VEC, VEI, and the challenges of centralized learning. The keywords should be terms that define the field or areas of study. For example, \"distributed systems\" and \"federated learning\" are relevant here. Then, specific keywords like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" would be ignored because they are technical terms related to the methods discussed.\n\nI should check each sentence to identify these terms. The first sentence mentions AI, so \"AI\" is a conceptual keyword. Then \"VEI\" and \"VEC\" are part of the system architecture. The challenges mentioned are \"traditional centralized learning\" and \"mobility,\" which are specific but part of the technical aspects. The ASFL scheme and its methods like federated learning are also conceptual, so they should be included. Finally, the future directions are part of the research, which are general and not specific.\n\nWait, the user specified to extract only the conceptual keywords. So even if the paper talks about specific methods, those terms should be excluded. For example, \"non-iid data\" is a technical term, so it's ignored. The ASFL scheme is a method, so it's a conceptual keyword. The final directions are part of the research, which are general, so they're excluded. So the output list should include \"AI\", \"VEI\", \"VEC\", \"distributed systems\", \"federated learning\", \"non-iid data\", \"stragglers\", \"Adam optimizer\", \"CIFAR-10 dataset\", and \"parallel\" or \"communication and computation efficiency\". Wait, the original text mentions \"adaptive split federated learning (ASFL)\" and \"operating in parallel\". So \"ASFL\" and \"parallel\" are conceptual terms. Also, \"model performance under non-IID data distribution\" is a specific challenge, so it's excluded.

By integrating AI technologies into vehicular edge computing (VEC) platforms, which provide essential storage, computing, and network resources, vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) can be fully realized. Traditional centralized learning, as one of the enabling technologies for VEI, places significant strain on network bandwidth while also increasing latency and privacy concerns. Nowadays, distributed machine learning methods, such as federated learning (FL), split learning (SL), and split federated learning (SFL), are widely applied in vehicular networks to support VEI. However, these methods still face significant challenges due to the mobility and constrained resources inherent in vehicular networks. In this article, we first provide an overview of the system architecture, performance metrics, and challenges associated with VEI design. Then, the adaptive design of SFL, namely adaptive split federated learning (ASFL) is introduced. The proposed ASFL scheme dynamically adapts the cut layer selection process and operates in parallel, optimizing both communication and computation efficiency while improving model performance under non-IID data distribution.

        "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this keyword extraction plan. The user wants to extract conceptual keywords from an academic text, specifically focusing on the first part of the provided paper summary. The paper is about integrating AI into vehicular edge computing (VEC) platforms to enhance AI-driven services, and the main challenge is the traditional centralized learning methods' issues like strain on network bandwidth and privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and output. The input is the academic text, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. The user mentioned that the plan should follow the core strategy of differentiating between conceptual and specific keywords. So, I need to split the text into these two categories.\n\nStarting with the input, the paper is about AI, VEC, VEI, and the challenges of centralized learning. The keywords should be terms that define the field or areas of study. For example, \"distributed systems\" and \"federated learning\" are relevant here. Then, specific keywords like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" would be ignored because they are technical terms related to the methods discussed.\n\nI should check each sentence to identify these terms. The first sentence mentions AI, so \"AI\" is a conceptual keyword. Then \"VEI\" and \"VEC\" are part of the system architecture. The challenges mentioned are \"traditional centralized learning\" and \"mobility,\" which are specific but part of the technical aspects. The ASFL scheme and its methods like federated learning are also conceptual, so they should be included. Finally, the future directions are part of the research, which are general and not specific.\n\nWait, the user specified to extract only the conceptual keywords. So even if the paper talks about specific methods, those terms should be excluded. For example, \"non-iid data\" is a technical term, so it's ignored. The ASFL scheme is a method, so it's a conceptual keyword. The final directions are part of the research, which are general, so they're excluded. So the output list should include \"AI\", \"VEI\", \"VEC\", \"distributed systems\", \"federated learning\", \"non-iid data\", \"stragglers\", \"Adam optimizer\", \"CIFAR-10 dataset\", and \"parallel\" or \"communication and computation efficiency\". Wait, the original text mentions \"adaptive split federated learning (ASFL)\" and \"operating in parallel\". So \"ASFL\" and \"parallel\" are conceptual terms. Also, \"model performance under non-IID data distribution\" is a specific challenge, so it's excluded. So the final list should include all the conceptual terms identified in the text, excluding the specific ones.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n**Input:** Academic text (e.g., \"To achieve ubiquitous intelligence in future vehicular networks, artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for extracting valuable insights from vehicular data to enhance AI-driven services.

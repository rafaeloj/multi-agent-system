  "summary": "Combing distributed small wireless systems on mobile platforms such as swarm airborne mini-drones has been explored recently. Localization and synchronization of the mobile drones are the main challenges limiting its practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to circumvent this limits by considering the drones as relay nodes, where the received signals are modulated to different frequencies and then re-transmitted to the final receiver for demodulation and beamforming. Real-time adaptive beamformer algorithm is used to compensate for the phase delay difference among drone elements in RF circuitry and in propagation paths caused by different drone elements positions. A beamforming array based on two-drones uses to demonstrate this concept. Improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) has been experimentally demonstrated with such beamforming approach. The proposed beamforming system architecture is expected to extend to a large of number distributed mini-drones for future wireless sensing and communication systems.",

The core strategy is to differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. So, first, I should read the text carefully and identify the main ideas.\n\nThe paper is about distributed small wireless systems, specifically swarm airborne mini-drones. The main challenges are localization and synchronization, which are high-level terms. Then, the approach involves relay nodes, modulating signals, and using beamforming. The SNR is improved, and the beamforming array is used for demonstration. The goal is to extract terms that define the field, like \"distributed systems\" or \"relay nodes,\" and ignore those related to specific technical aspects like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers.\"\n\nNow, I need to structure the plan step-by-step. The input is an academic text, so I'll start by reading it and identifying the main concepts. Then, categorize them into conceptual and specific. For conceptual, terms like \"distributed systems,\" \"relay nodes,\" \"mobile drones,\" \"localization,\" \"synchronization,\" \"beamforming,\" \"SNR,\" \"real-time adaptive,\" \"wireless sensing,\" and \"communication systems.\" For specific, terms like \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"Adam optimizer,\" \"CIFAR-10 dataset,\" \"RF circuitry,\" \"phase delay,\" \"propagation paths,\" \"beamforming array,\" \"two-drones,\" \"experimentally demonstrated,\" \"large number of distributed mini-drones.\"\n\nWait, the user mentioned to ignore specific keywords.

The text mentions \"distributed systems,\" \"relay nodes,\" \"mobile drones,\" \"localization,\" \"synchronization,\" \"beamforming,\" \"SNR,\" \"real-time adaptive,\" \"wireless sensing,\" \"communication systems.\" Yes, those are all conceptual. Specific ones are the technical terms. So the plan should list these as the output. Make sure to mention that the output is a list of keywords, and the input is the academic text. No markdown, just plain text.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n\n**Input:**  \n- Academic text: *\"Combing distributed small wireless systems on mobile platforms such as swarm airborne mini-drones has been explored recently. Localization and synchronization of the mobile drones are the main challenges limiting its practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to circumvent this limits by considering the drones as relay nodes, where the received signals are modulated to different frequencies and then re-transmitted to the final receiver for demodulation and beamforming. Real-time adaptive beamformer algorithm is used to compensate for the phase delay difference among drone elements in RF circuitry and in propagation paths caused by different drone elements positions. A beamforming array based on two-drones uses to demonstrate this concept. Improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) has been experimentally demonstrated with such beamforming approach. The proposed beamforming system architecture is expected to extend to a large number of distributed mini-drones for future wireless sensing and communication systems.\"*  \n\n**Output:**  \n- List of **Conceptual / Thematic Keywords**:  \n  - **Distributed systems**  \n  - **Wireless systems**  \n  - **Swarm airborne mini-drones**  \n  - **Relay nodes**  \n  - **Mobile drones**  \n  - **Localization**  \n  - **Synchronization**  \n  - **Beamforming**  \n  - **SNR**  \n  - **Real-time adaptive**  \n  - **Wireless sensing**  \n  - **Communication systems**  \n\n**Note:**  \n- Specific keywords (e.g., \"non-iid data\", \"stragglers\", \"Adam optimizer\", \"CIFAR-10 dataset\") are **ignored**.  \n- The plan ensures that only high-level, field-specific terms are extracted.",

The text mentions \"distributed small wireless systems on mobile platforms\" and \"localization and synchronization of the mobile drones.\" Then there's the approach using relay nodes, modulated signals, and beamforming algorithms. Also, the SNR and beamforming array.\n\nSo, the first step is to list all nouns, noun phrases, and technical terms. Let's break it down. \"Distributed small wireless systems\" is a technical term. \"Mobile platforms\" and \"swarm airborne mini-drones\" are also there. \"Localization and synchronization\" are nouns. Then \"relay nodes\" and \"modulated signals\" are terms. \"Beamforming array\" and \"beamforming\" are technical. \"SNR\" is a technical term. \"Wireless sensing and communication systems\" are the main applications.\n\nNow, applying the core test: is the term a conference-topic or paper-detail? For \"distributed small wireless systems,\" it's a conference topic. \"Localization and synchronization\" are part of the paper's challenges, so they fail. \"Relay nodes\" and \"modulated signals\" are part of the approach, so they fail. \"Beamforming array\" and \"beamforming\" are part of the paper's method, so they fail. \"SNR\" is a technical term, so it passes. \"Wireless sensing and communication systems\" are applications, so they pass. Wait, but the example in the previous step had \"federated learning\" as a conference term. So here, \"distributed systems\" is a conference topic, so it passes. So the final list would be \"distributed systems,\" \"SNR,\" and maybe \"beamforming array.\" Let me check again.

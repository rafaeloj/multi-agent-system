  "summary": "The detection and classification of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are disturbing challenges within contemporary radar systems, wherein the physical characteristics of UAVs, including their size and radar cross section (RCS), exert a substantial influence on radar’s detection capabilities. Smaller UAVs, characterized by reduced RCS values, often escape radar detection. In response to these challenges, this study introduces an efficient radar signal processing technique based on beamforming, termed range–Doppler integration while steering (RDIwS). RDIwS significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) associated with UAVs, resulting in an increased detection probability and classification accuracy for these UAVs. Importantly, the RDIwS approach demonstrates superior performance to traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) methods and established beamforming-based techniques, showcasing its potential to significantly advance UAV detection and classification across various operational contexts. For four targets located at different angles and distances scenario, and at −30 dB SNR and false alarm probability of 10−5 , the RDIwS beamforming-based method achieved a detection probability of 75% compared to 5% for steering-only beamforming, and no detection for MIMO radar case.",

  "final_decision": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a final report in Markdown format, recommending two conferences: ICVARS 2026 and EXPLAINABILITY 2026. Each should have an acronym, name, deadline, location, and a WikiCFP link. Also, there are additional_info entries with titles and links.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the report properly. Start with the title, then list each conference. For ICVARS 2026, check the details: acronym, name, date, location, topics. The date is from July 15 to 17, 2026. Location is Chalon-sur-Saône, France. Topics are a list of 18 topics. The link provided is the ICVARS website. Then, EXPLAINABILITY 2026 has its own details. The date is September 27 to October 1, 2026, location Barcelona, Spain. Topics are a bit longer, but the user included the same topics as ICVARS. The link is the EXPLAINABILITY CFP page.\n\nWait, the user provided two entries for EXPLAINABILITY, but in the initial data, there's only one.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this keyword extraction plan. The user wants to extract conceptual keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to understand the task clearly. The core strategy is to differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. So, first, I should read through the paper summary to identify the main concepts.\n\nThe paper is about UAV detection using a new radar technique called RDIwS. The key points are the physical characteristics of UAVs, their RCS, and the impact on radar detection. Then, the new method's performance compared to traditional methods. \n\nSo, the conceptual keywords here would be terms related to UAVs, radar, signal processing, beamforming, and detection accuracy. Specific keywords would be things like \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"CIFAR-10,\" \"MIMO,\" \"beamforming,\" and \"SNR.\" \n\nI need to make sure I'm not including the technical terms that are specific to the problem. For example, \"non-iid data\" and \"stragglers\" are specific to the dataset or problem, so they should be ignored. The RDIwS approach is a new method, so that's a conceptual keyword. Also, the detection probability and accuracy metrics are part of the study, but they're technical details and should be excluded.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to extract only the conceptual keywords. So, the plan should list all the high-level terms. Let me check again. The paper talks about UAVs, radar, signal processing, beamforming, and detection. Also, the comparison with other methods shows the RDIwS's superiority, so that's a conceptual keyword. \n\nI need to structure the plan step-by-step. First, define the input as an academic text. Then, identify the two types of keywords. For the first, list the terms like UAVs, radar, signal processing, beamforming, and detection. For the second, exclude specific terms. Finally, present the list. Make sure to mention that the output is a list of keywords. \n\nDouble-check for any possible mistakes. For example, \"non-iid data\" and \"stragglers\" are specific, so they should be ignored. The RDIwS approach is a method, so that's a keyword. The detection probability and accuracy are technical, so they're excluded. \n\nYes, that should cover it. Now, present the plan clearly with the input and output.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n\n#### **Input:**  \n- Academic text: *\"The detection and classification of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are disturbing challenges within contemporary radar systems, wherein the physical characteristics of UAVs, including their size and radar cross section (RCS), exert a substantial influence on radar’s detection capabilities. Smaller UAVs, characterized by reduced RCS values, often escape radar detection. In response to these challenges, this study introduces an efficient radar signal processing technique based on beamforming, termed range–Doppler integration while steering (RDIwS). RDIwS significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) associated with UAVs, resulting in an increased detection probability and classification accuracy for these UAVs. Importantly, the RDIwS approach demonstrates superior performance to traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) methods and established beamforming-based techniques, showcasing its potential to significantly advance UAV detection and classification across various operational contexts. For four targets located at different angles and distances scenario, and at −30 dB SNR and false alarm probability of 10−5 , the RDIwS beamforming-based method achieved a detection probability of 75% compared to 5% for steering-only beamforming, and no detection for MIMO radar case.\"*  \n\n#### **Output:**  \n- List of **Conceptual / Thematic Keywords**:  \n  - UAVs  \n  - Radar  \n  - Signal Processing  \n  - Beamforming  \n  - Detection  \n  - Range–Doppler Integration  \n  - Doppler  \n  - SNR  \n  - Detection Probability  \n  - Classification Accuracy  \n  - UAV Detection  \n  - MIMO  \n  - Range  \n  - False Alarm Probability  \n\n#### **Explanation**:  \n- **Conceptual Keywords**: High-level terms defining research fields, paradigms, or broad areas (e.g., \"UAVs\", \"radar\", \"beamforming\").  \n- **Specific Keywords**: Low-level terms describing technical details (e.g., \"non-iid data\", \"stragglers\", \"CIFAR-10\", \"MIMO\", \"beamforming\").  \n\nThis plan ensures exclusion of technical specifics while retaining high-level research concepts.",
      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the conceptual keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to identify all the potential candidate terms from the text. The text is about UAVs and radar systems.\n\nFirst, I'll look for nouns, noun phrases, and technical terms. The text mentions \"unmanned air vehicles (UAVs)\", \"radar systems\", \"physical characteristics of UAVs\", \"radar cross section (RCS)\", \"beamforming\", \"range–Doppler integration while steering (RDIwS)\", \"signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\", \"detection probability\", \"classification accuracy\", \"operational contexts\", \"four targets\", \"different angles and distances\", \"-30 dB SNR\", \"false alarm probability\", \"beamforming-based methods\", \"MIMO radar\", \"superior performance\", \"significantly advance\".\n\nNow, applying the core test: Is the term more likely to be a conference/workshop topic or a paper's detail? Let's check each term.\n\n\"UAVs\" is a conference topic, so it passes. \"Radar systems\" is a conference topic, so it passes. \"RCS\" is a technical term, but it's part of the paper's detail, so it fails. \"Beamforming\" is a technique, but it's part of the paper's detail, so it fails. \"Range–Doppler integration while steering (RDIwS)\" is a method, but it's part of the paper's detail, so it fails. \"SNR\" is a detail, so it fails. \"Detection probability\" and \"classification accuracy\" are details, so they fail. \"Operational contexts\" and \"four targets\" are details. \"Different angles and distances\" is a detail. \"-30 dB SNR\" and \"false alarm probability\" are details. \"Beamforming-based methods\" and \"MIMO radar\" are details. \"Significantly advance\" is a detail. \n\nSo the only terms that passed are \"UAVs\" and \"radar systems\". Wait, but the example in the previous step had \"federated learning\" and \"Networking\". So maybe in this case, the correct terms are \"UAVs\" and \"radar systems\". Let me double-check. The original text mentions \"beamforming\", which is a technique, but it's part of the paper's detail, so it should be excluded. So the final answer should be \"UAVs, radar systems\".\n</think>\n\nUAVs, radar systems",

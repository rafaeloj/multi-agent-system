  "summary": "Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the field of machine learning (ML) to address resource management, interference management, autonomy, and decision-making in wireless networks. Traditional ML approaches rely on centralized methods, where data is collected at a central server for training. However, this approach poses a challenge in terms of preserving the data privacy of devices. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution that allows edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without compromising data privacy. In FL, local datasets are not shared, and the focus is on learning a global model for a specific task involving all devices. However, FL has limitations when it comes to adapting the model to devices with different data distributions. In such cases, meta learning is considered, as it enables the adaptation of learning models to different data distributions using only a few data samples. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive review of FL, meta learning, and federated meta learning (FedMeta). Unlike other tutorial papers, our objective is to explore how FL, meta learning, and FedMeta methodologies can be designed, optimized, and evolved, and their applications over wireless networks. We also analyze the relationships among these learning algorithms and examine their advantages and disadvantages in real-world applications.",

The core strategy is to differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. So, I should start by reading the paper summary and identifying the main concepts.\n\nThe paper talks about advancements in machine learning, specifically in wireless networks. The key terms here are \"machine learning,\" \"resource management,\" \"interference management,\" \"autonomy,\" \"decision-making,\" \"federated learning,\" \"meta learning,\" and \"federated meta learning.\" These are all high-level terms that define the fields or approaches mentioned. \n\nNext, I need to check if there are any specific technical terms that need to be ignored. The text mentions \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"Adam optimizer,\" and \"CIFAR-10 dataset.\" These are low-level terms related to the technical aspects of the ML methods. So, they should be excluded.\n\nNow, I need to structure the plan step by step. The input is an academic text, so I'll start by reading through the text to identify the keywords. Then, categorize them into conceptual and specific. Finally, present the list of conceptual keywords. I should make sure to highlight the main points and ensure that the plan is clear and follows the core strategy as outlined.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n**Input:** Academic text (e.g., paper summary)  \n**Output:** List of **Conceptual / Thematic Keywords**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Read and Identify High-Level Terms**  \n1. **Identify broad concepts**:  \n   - \"Machine learning\" (high-level term)  \n   - \"Wireless networks\" (contextual field)  \n   - \"Resource management\" (domain)  \n   - \"Interference management\" (technical challenge)  \n   - \"Autonomy\" (system behavior)  \n   - \"Decision-making\" (process)  \n   - \"Federated learning\" (methodology)  \n   - \"Meta learning\" (algorithm)  \n   - \"Federated meta learning\" (methodology variant)  \n\n2. **Note key terms**:  \n   - \"Federated learning\" (method)  \n   - \"Meta learning\" (algorithm)  \n   - \"Federated meta learning\" (method)  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Filter Specific / Technical Keywords**  \n1. **Exclude low-level terms**:  \n   - \"Non-iid data\" (data distribution)  \n   - \"Stragglers\" (data quality)  \n   - \"Adam optimizer\" (algorithm)  \n   - \"CIFAR-10 dataset\" (dataset)  \n\n2. **Highlight high-level terms**:  \n   - \"Resource management\" (domain)  \n   - \"Interference management\" (challenge)  \n   - \"Autonomy\" (system behavior)  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalize the List**  \n**Conceptual / Thematic Keywords List**:  \n- Machine learning  \n- Wireless networks  \n- Resource management  \n- Interference management  \n- Autonomy  \n- Decision-making  \n- Federated learning  \n- Meta learning  \n- Federated meta learning  \n\nThis list captures the overarching themes and methodologies discussed in the paper, focusing on high-level concepts rather than technical details.",

The text mentions several things: machine learning, resource management, interference management, autonomy, decision-making in wireless networks, centralized methods, data privacy, federated learning, edge devices, non-iid data, dynamic network environments, meta learning, and wireless networks.\n\nNow, applying the core test: is the term more likely to be in a conference/workshop title than a paper? Let's check each term.\n\n\"Machine learning\" – it's a field, not a specific topic. So maybe not. \"Resource management\" – again, a field. \"Interference management\" – same. \"Autonomy\" – not a specific topic. \"Decision-making in wireless networks\" – that's a specific topic. \"Centralized methods\" – again, a field. \"Data privacy\" – a topic. \"Federated learning\" – a specific topic. \"Edge devices\" – not a specific topic. \"Non-iid data\" – a specific term in a paper. \"Dynamic network environments\" – a specific term. \"Meta learning\" – a specific topic. \"Wireless networks\" – a specific topic.\n\nSo the terms that pass the test are \"federated learning\", \"non-iid data\", \"dynamic network environments\", \"privacy\", \"distributed systems\". Wait, but in the example given, \"distributed systems\" was included. Let me check again. The example had \"distributed systems\" as a keyword.

So maybe not. \"Resource management\" – again, a field. \"Interference management\" – same. \"Autonomy\" – not a specific topic. \"Decision-making in wireless networks\" – that's a specific topic. \"Centralized methods\" – again, a field. \"Data privacy\" – a topic. \"Federated learning\" – a specific topic. \"Edge devices\" – not a specific topic. \"Non-iid data\" – a specific term in a paper. \"Dynamic network environments\" – a specific term. \"Meta learning\" – a specific topic. \"Wireless networks\" – a specific topic.\n\nSo the terms that pass the test are \"federated learning\", \"non-iid data\", \"dynamic network environments\", \"privacy\", \"distributed systems\". Wait, but in the example given, \"distributed systems\" was included. Let me check again. The example had \"distributed systems\" as a keyword. So in this case, \"distributed systems\" is a conference-level topic. So all those terms are correct. The internal list should be those terms separated by commas.\n</think>\n\nfederated learning, non-iid data, dynamic network environments, privacy, distributed systems"

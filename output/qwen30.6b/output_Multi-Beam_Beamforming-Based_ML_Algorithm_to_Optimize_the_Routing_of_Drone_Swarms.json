  "summary": "The advancement of wireless networking has significantly enhanced beamforming capabilities in Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (AUAS). This paper presents a simple and efficient classical algorithm to route a collection of AUAS or drone swarms extending our previous work on AUAS. The algorithm is based on the sparse factorization of frequency Vandermonde matrices that correspond to each drone, and its entries are determined through spatiotemporal data of drones in the AUAS. The algorithm relies on multibeam beamforming, making it suitable for large-scale AUAS networking in wireless communications. We show a reduction in the arithmetic and time complexities of the algorithm through theoretical and numerical results. Finally, we also present an ML-based AUAS routing algorithm using the classical AUAS algorithm and feed-forward neural networks. We compare the beamformed signals of the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm with the ground truth signals to minimize the error between them. The numerical error results show that the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm enhances the accuracy of the routing. This error, along with the numerical and theoretical results for over 100 drones, provides the basis for the scalability of the proposed ML-based AUAS algorithms for large-scale deployments.",

They provided two recommended conferences with their details, and I need to present them in a structured way.\n\nFirst, the report should be in Markdown, so I'll use the appropriate syntax. The user mentioned including the acronym, name, deadline, location, conference topics, and an additional info section with the snippet. Let me check each entry.\n\nFor the first conference, ICCCM 2026: The acronym is ICCCM--EI 2026, the date is July 24-26, 2026, location Tokyo, Japan. The topics are Communication Theory and Techniques, Networking, Signal Processing & Image Processing. The additional info has the title and snippet from the link. I need to make sure all these details are included.\n\nThe second conference is ICISPC 2026: The acronym is ICISPC--EI 2026, date July 11-13, 2026, location Kobe, Japan. Topics are Imaging sensing technique and processing, Communication technology, Multimedia and Communication Systems. The additional info is the title from the link and the snippet.\n\nI should structure the report with sections like \"Recommended Conferences\" and then list each conference with its details. Make sure to use the correct markdown syntax, like using double-quotes for the links and proper formatting. Also, check that all the required fields are present and correctly formatted.

Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the Conceptual/Thematic Keywords. Terms like \"Wireless Networking\" and \"Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (AUAS)\" come to mind. These are high-level terms related to the field. Then, \"Beamforming\" and \"Multibeam Beamforming\" are specific to the algorithm. Also, \"Routing\" and \"ML-Based AUAS Routing\" are technical terms. \n\nNext, the Specific/Technical Keywords. The text mentions \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"Adam optimizer,\" \"CIFAR-10 dataset,\" and \"spatiotemporal data.\" These are low-level terms that need to be ignored. \n\nI need to structure the plan step-by-step. Start by reading the input text, then identify the high-level terms. For each paragraph, extract the relevant keywords. Make sure to exclude the specific ones. Finally, present the list of Conceptual keywords. Let me check if I missed anything. The algorithm's complexity and ML-based routing are part of the technical terms.

      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract the conference-level keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to identify all potential candidate terms from the text. The text is about wireless networking, autonomous unmanned aerial systems (AUAS), and their algorithms.\n\nFirst, I'll look for nouns, noun phrases, and technical terms. The text mentions \"wireless networking,\" \"beamforming,\" \"federated learning,\" \"spatiotemporal data,\" \"spike-and-wave,\" \"frequency Vandermonde matrices,\" \"multibeam beamforming,\" \"large-scale AUAS,\" \"wireless communications,\" \"drone swarms,\" \"classical AUAS,\" \"feed-forward neural networks,\" \"accuracy,\" \"error,\" \"scalability,\" \"over 100 drones.\"\n\nNow, applying the core test: Is the term more likely to be a conference/workshop topic or a paper's detail? Let's check each term.\n\n\"Wireless networking\" – it's a conference topic, so it passes.\n\n\"Beamforming\" – it's a technical term related to communication, so it's a paper detail. Wait, but the example in the previous step had \"federated learning\" as a conference term. So maybe \"beamforming\" is a paper term. But the example used \"federated learning\" as a conference term. So maybe the test is whether it's a conference topic or a paper detail. So if it's a conference topic, like \"Wireless Networking,\" it passes. If it's a paper detail, like \"beamforming\" (as in the example), then it fails. Wait, but in the example, \"non-iid data\" failed, so that's a paper detail. So \"beamforming\" here is a paper term. So maybe \"beamforming\" is a paper term, so it should fail. But the example used \"federated learning\" as a conference term. So the test is whether the term is a conference or paper detail. So if it's a conference, pass; if a paper, fail.\n\nSo for each term:\n\nWireless networking – conference, pass.\n\nBeamforming – paper, fail.\n\nSpatiotemporal data – paper, fail.\n\nFrequency Vandermonde matrices – paper, fail.\n\nMultibeam beamforming – paper, fail.\n\nLarge-scale AUAS – conference, pass.\n\nWireless communications – conference, pass.\n\nDrone swarms – conference, pass.\n\nClassical AUAS – conference, pass.\n\nFeed-forward neural networks – paper, fail.\n\nAccuracy – paper, fail.\n\nError – paper, fail.\n\nScalability – paper, fail.\n\nOver 100 drones – paper, fail.\n\nSo the keywords that passed are Wireless Networking, Large-scale AUAS, and Networking. Wait, but in the example, \"Networking\" was a conference term. So maybe \"Wireless Networking\" is a conference term, and \"Networking\" is a conference term. So the list would be Wireless Networking, Networking, Large-scale AUAS. But the example had \"federated learning\" and \"Networking\" as two entries. So maybe the user wants all the conference terms. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal text: \"Wireless networking has significantly enhanced beamforming capabilities in Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (AUAS). This paper presents a simple and efficient classical algorithm to route a collection of AUAS or drone swarms extending our previous work on AUAS. The algorithm is based on the sparse factorization of frequency Vandermonde matrices that correspond to each drone, and its entries are determined through spatiotemporal data of drones in the AUAS. The algorithm relies on multibeam beamforming, making it suitable for large-scale AUAS networking in wireless communications. We show a reduction in the arithmetic and time complexities of the algorithm through theoretical and numerical results. Finally, we also present an ML-based AUAS routing algorithm using the classical AUAS algorithm and feed-forward neural networks. We compare the beamformed signals of the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm with the ground truth signals to minimize the error between them. The numerical error results show that the ML-based AUAS routing algorithm enhances the accuracy of the routing. This error, along with the numerical and theoretical results for over 100 drones, provides the basis for the scalability of the proposed ML-based AUAS algorithms for large-scale deployments.\"\n\nSo the conference terms are \"Wireless Networking\" (as in the example), \"Networking\" (as in the example), \"Large-scale AUAS\" (as in the example), and \"Wireless Communications\" (as in the example). Wait, but in the example, \"Networking\" was a conference term. So maybe \"Wireless Networking\" and \"Networking\" are both conference terms. So the list would be Wireless Networking, Networking, Large-scale AUAS, Wireless Communications. But the example had \"federated learning\" and \"Networking\" as two entries. So perhaps the user wants all the conference terms, even if they are similar. So the answer would be Wireless Networking, Networking, Large-scale AUAS, Wireless Communications.

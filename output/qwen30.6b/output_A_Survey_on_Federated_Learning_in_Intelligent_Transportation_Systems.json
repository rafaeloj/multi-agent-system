  "summary": "The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we describe the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications. Besides, we discuss the existing challenges and potential future research directions for FL-based ITS.",

The additional info includes a link to the PRML website.\n\nNow, I need to format this into a Markdown report. The user wants the report to be in Markdown, so I'll start with the title. Then list each conference with their details. Make sure to include all the required fields: acronym, name, deadline, location, topics, and additional info.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to create a step-by-step plan for extracting conceptual keywords from an academic text. The input is the paper summary provided, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core strategy mentioned. The plan should differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. Conceptual keywords are high-level terms like \"Distributed Systems\" or \"Federated Learning,\" while specific ones like \"non-iid data\" are to be ignored.\n\nSo, the first step would be to read the paper summary and identify the main themes. The paper talks about ITS, traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. Then, I need to look for terms that define these areas. For example, \"ITS\" is a conceptual keyword. \"Federated Learning\" is another, as it's a method used in the paper. Then, check for any specific terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" but note they are specific and should be excluded.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to ignore specific keywords. So, in the output, I need to list only the conceptual ones. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other terms. The paper also discusses the limitations of centralized training, which relates to the FL approach, so \"federated learning\" is there. Also, the scenarios mentioned are traffic flow prediction, recognition, and edge computing, which are the contexts. So the output should be a list like \"Distributed Systems, Federated Learning, traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, vehicular edge computing.\" That covers all the key areas mentioned in the paper.\n\nI should structure the plan step-by-step, starting with reading the text, identifying the main themes, then filtering out specific terms, and finally listing the extracted keywords. Make sure to mention that the output is a list of these terms. Double-check that I didn't miss any other terms.

Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we describe the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications. Besides, we discuss the existing challenges and potential future research directions for FL-based ITS.\"*  \n\n#### **Final Output:**  \n- **Conceptual Keywords:**  \n  - Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)  \n  - Traffic Flow Prediction  \n  - Traffic Target Recognition  \n  - Vehicular Edge Computing  \n  - Federated Learning (FL)  \n\n#### **Explanation:**  \n1. **Read the Text:** Identify the main themes and key terms.  \n2. **Filter Specific Keywords:** Ignore terms like \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"CIFAR-10 dataset,\" and \"Adam optimizer.\"  \n3. **Extract Conceptual Keywords:** Focus on high-level terms like \"ITS,\" \"FL,\" and the contexts mentioned (traffic scenarios).  \n4. **Verify Accuracy:** Ensure the keywords align with the paper’s focus areas and are not specific to the text.",
      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the conference-level keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to identify all potential candidate terms from the text. The text is about Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), their applications, and the use of federated learning (FL).\n\nFirst, I'll list all the nouns, noun phrases, and technical terms. The text mentions \"ITS\", \"traffic flow prediction\", \"traffic target recognition\", \"vehicular edge computing\", \"centralized training approach\", \"data silos\", \"data privacy\", \"federated learning\", \"FL\", \"ITS applications\", \"scenario\", \"key characteristics\", \"current challenges\", \"FL leveraged\", \"benefits\", \"existing challenges\", \"future research directions\".\n\nNow, applying the core test: is the term more likely to be a conference/workshop topic or a paper's detail? For each term, check if it's a conference-level topic. \n\n\"ITS\" is a conference, so it passes. \"Traffic flow prediction\" and \"traffic target recognition\" are part of ITS, so they pass. \"Vehicular edge computing\" is a technical term related to ITS, so it passes. \"Centralized training approach\" is a paper detail, so it fails. \"Data silos\" and \"data privacy\" are paper details, so they fail. \"Federated learning\" is a conference topic, so it passes. \"FL\" is a conference keyword, so it passes. The other terms are either details or not conference topics.\n\nSo the internal list should include \"ITS\", \"traffic flow prediction\", \"traffic target recognition\", \"vehicular edge computing\", \"federated learning\". Wait, but the example had \"federated learning\" as a keyword. Also, \"Networking\" and \"Dynamic Systems\" are mentioned in the example. Let me check again. In the example, \"Networking\" and \"Dynamic Systems\" are considered conference topics. In the given text, \"dynamic network environments\" is part of the scenario, which could be \"Networking\" or \"Dynamic Systems\". So \"dynamic network environments\" would pass as a conference keyword. Similarly, \"distributed systems\" is a conference topic. So in the given text, \"distributed systems\" is a conference keyword. So the internal list should include \"federated learning\", \"Networking\", \"Dynamic Systems\", \"distributed systems\", \"traffic flow prediction\", \"traffic target recognition\".\n\nWait, the user's example included \"federated learning\" and \"Networking\". So in the given text, \"dynamic network environments\" and \"distributed systems\" are conference keywords. So the final answer should list those terms.\n</think>\n\nfederated learning, networking, dynamic systems, distributed systems, traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition",

        "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to create a step-by-step plan for extracting conceptual keywords from an academic text. The input is the paper summary provided, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core strategy mentioned. The plan should differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. Conceptual keywords are high-level terms like \"Distributed Systems\" or \"Federated Learning,\" while specific ones like \"non-iid data\" are to be ignored.\n\nSo, the first step would be to read the paper summary and identify the main themes. The paper talks about ITS, traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. Then, I need to look for terms that define these areas. For example, \"ITS\" is a conceptual keyword. \"Federated Learning\" is another, as it's a method used in the paper. Then, check for any specific terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" but note they are specific and should be excluded.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to ignore specific keywords. So, in the output, I need to list only the conceptual ones. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other terms. The paper also discusses the limitations of centralized training, which relates to the FL approach, so \"federated learning\" is there. Also, the scenarios mentioned are traffic flow prediction, recognition, and edge computing, which are the contexts. So the output should be a list like \"Distributed Systems, Federated Learning, traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, vehicular edge computing.\" That covers all the key areas mentioned in the paper.\n\nI should structure the plan step-by-step, starting with reading the text, identifying the main themes, then filtering out specific terms, and finally listing the extracted keywords. Make sure to mention that the output is a list of these terms. Double-check that I didn't miss any other terms.

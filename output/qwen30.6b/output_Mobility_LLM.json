  "summary": "Location-based services (LBS) have accumulated extensive human mobility data on diverse behaviors through check-in sequences. These sequences offer valuable insights into users’ intentions and preferences. Yet, existing models analyzing check-in sequences fail to consider the semantics contained in these sequences, which closely reflect human visiting intentions and travel preferences, leading to an incomplete comprehension. Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users’ travel preferences. These components enhance the model’s ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the effectiveness of Mobility-LLM in advancing our understanding of human mobility data within LBS contexts.",

Also, the user provided three conferences, each with their own details.\n\nFirst, I should structure the report. Since it's a final report, it should be organized with sections like Introduction, Recommended Conferences, etc. The user mentioned using Markdown, so I need to make sure the formatting is correct. Each conference entry should be a separate section, using the specified fields.\n\nI need to check the data provided. For the first conference, the name is AAI 2026 Bridge Program, acronym WMAC 2026, deadline October 31, 2025, location Singapore, topics listed. The link is provided, so I should include that.

The input is the paper summary provided, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core strategy. The plan should differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. Conceptual keywords are high-level terms like \"Distributed Systems\" or \"Federated Learning,\" while specific ones are things like \"non-iid data.\" The task is to extract only the conceptual ones.\n\nLooking at the paper summary, the main focus is on LBS (location-based services) and their check-in sequences. The keywords mentioned are \"Location-based services,\" \"Check-in sequences,\" \"Semantics,\" \"Human visiting intentions,\" \"Travel preferences,\" \"LLM,\" \"Mobility-LLM,\" \"Semantic understanding,\" \"Contextual processing,\" \"Human mobility data,\" \"Downstream tasks,\" and \"Experiments.\" \n\nI need to make sure I'm not including specific terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" as they are specific. The user wants only the conceptual ones. So, for each term in the summary, check if it's a high-level concept. For example, \"Location-based services\" is a conceptual keyword. \"Check-in sequences\" is also a keyword. \"Semantics\" and \"Semantic understanding\" are high-level terms. \"Human visiting intentions\" and \"Travel preferences\" are about the context. \"LLM\" and \"Mobility-LLM\" are frameworks, so they should be included as they are conceptual. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that specific keywords like \"non-iid data\" should be ignored.

      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the conceptual keywords from the given academic text. The task is to identify terms that are more likely to be conference or workshop keywords rather than just paper details. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the text and identify all potential candidate terms. The text is about location-based services and their check-in sequences. Let me break it down.\n\nThe first term is \"Location-based services (LBS)\". Since LBS is a conference or workshop topic, this should pass. Next, \"check-in sequences\". That's part of the context, but maybe it's a paper detail. Wait, the example in the previous step used terms like \"non-iid data\" which failed because they were paper details. So \"check-in sequences\" might be a paper detail. But the user's instruction says to filter for conference-level terms. So maybe \"check-in sequences\" is a paper detail and should be excluded. \n\nThen \"user's intentions and preferences\". That's part of the paper's content, so it's a detail. Next, \"dynamic network environments\". That's a conference topic, so it should pass. \"Privacy\" is mentioned in the context, so that's a conference keyword. \"Large-scale distributed systems\" is part of the context, so that's a conference term. \n\nWait, the example in the previous step had \"non-iid data\" which failed because it's a paper detail.

      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a CFP for the AAAI 2026 Bridge Program and wants me to check if the plan makes sense and verify all information from the conference. First, I need to parse the content and extract the key details.\n\nThe CFP includes event details like date, location, submission deadline, and organizers. The main topic is LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. The plan should extract these elements. Then, identify the main topics mentioned in the CFP. The user listed topics like interoperability, coordination, knowledge sharing, scalability, social norms, evaluation, and format. Also, there's mention of the format being a one-day program with invited talks.\n\nI need to structure the plan step by step, ensuring each step is clear. Check for any inconsistencies. For example, the submission deadline is October 31, 2025, and the notification is November 14, 2025. The program is in Singapore for the 2026 conference. Make sure all information is consistent with the CFP content. Also, verify that the topics are correctly listed and that the format details are accurate. If any parts don't match, correct them. Finally, present the plan clearly with examples.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Plan to Identify Conference Topics of Interest Based on the CFP Content**\n\n1. **Extract Core Information from the CFP**  \n   - **Event Name**: \"WMAC 2026 : AAAI 2026 Bridge Program for Advancing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration\"  \n   - **Date**: January 20, 2026  \n   - **Location**: Singapore  \n   - **Submission Deadline**: October 31, 2025  \n   - **Notification Due**: November 14, 2025  \n   - **Organizers**: Yusen Zhang (Columbia University), Alborz Geramifard, Alex Marin, Raphael Shu, Tao Yu, Weiyan Shi, and Yi Zhang (Acenta AI, University of Hong Kong, Amazon, etc.)  \n\n2. **Identify Key Topics Based on the CFP Content**  \n   - **Main Topics**:  \n     - **Interoperability**: Design of protocols/methodologies that support a set of heterogeneous LLM-based agents to communicate, share knowledge, and collaborate reliably across platforms and modalities.  \n     - **Coordination & Planning**: MAS methods (e.g., distributed planning, MARL-based methods) adapted to improve LLM-driven multi-agent systems that commonly use natural language as the interface of reasoning and communication.  \n     - **Knowledge Sharing & Memory**: Architectures for stable, transparent sharing of context and memory among heterogeneous agents.  \n     - **Scalability & Robustness**: Scaling from small teams of agents to large, dynamic populations while preventing instability.  \n     - **Social Norms & Governance**: Embedding MAS insights on incentives, trust, and governance into LLM agents to ensure alignment across a large number of agents.  \n     - **Evaluation & Benchmarks**: Benchmarking the collaboration aspect of an LLM-based multi-agent system, such as extending the MAS benchmarks (e.g., PettingZoo, RoboCup).  \n\n3. **Organize the Topics into a Logical Flow**  \n   - **Prioritize**: Start with the most relevant topics based on the program’s focus on LLM-based multi-agent collaboration.  \n   - **Structure**: Present topics in order of importance, such as \"First Priority: [Topic 1], Next: [Topic 2], etc.\"  \n   - **Include Examples**: For each topic, provide a brief description and note its relevance to the CFP’s objectives.  \n\n4. **Ensure Clarity and Conciseness**  \n   - Avoid redundancy and ensure each step clearly outlines the process of identifying topics.  \n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for readability.  \n\n**Example Output**:  \n- **Step 1**: Extract the event details.  \n- **Step 2**: Identify the main topics.  \n- **Step 3**: Organize the topics in a logical sequence.  \n\n**Content Verification**:  \n- All information from the CFP is consistent with the plan.  \n- Topics are correctly listed and logically ordered.  \n- Format details (one-day program, invited talks) are accurately represented.  \n\n**Final Notes**:  \n- Ensure that all dates, organizers, and program details align with the CFP content.  \n- Maintain clarity and conciseness in the plan to facilitate accurate topic identification.",

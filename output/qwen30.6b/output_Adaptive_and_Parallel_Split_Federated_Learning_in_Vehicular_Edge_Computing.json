  "summary": "Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge–cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an adaptive split FL scheme for VEC (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on nonindependent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles’ mobility",

The user mentioned two conferences, both named Ei/Scopus-CMLDS 2026, but they have different links. Wait, the initial data shows two entries with the same acronym but different links. That's probably a mistake, but I should note that. Maybe the user made a typo, but I'll proceed with the given information.\n\nNext, the additional_info sections have two questions. I need to present them as separate sections. Each question should have a title, snippet, and link. The user wants the report to be in Markdown, so I'll structure each part accordingly.\n\nI should start by summarizing the recommended conferences. Since both are the same, maybe mention that they are the same event. Then list each with their details. The WikiCFP link is provided, so include that. The date and location are also important. Then, the additional_info sections with the questions and links. Make sure to format all sections properly in Markdown, using headings like \"Recommended Conferences\" and \"Additional Information\".\n\nCheck for any typos or inconsistencies. Ensure that the links are correctly formatted with http://... etc. Also, make sure the date is in the correct format, Mar 24, 2026. The location is Singapore.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract conceptual keywords from the given academic text. First, I need to understand what the task is. They want to focus on high-level terms like \"VEI\" and \"FL\" as conceptual keywords, while ignoring specific terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\".\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The main points are about Vehicular Edge Intelligence (VEI), Federated Learning (FL), split learning (SL), and their applications in VEC. The key terms here are VEI, FL, SL, and the specific terms like \"non-iid data\" and \"stragglers\" are to be ignored.\n\nNow, I need to identify the conceptual keywords. VEI and FL are clearly there. Then, SL is mentioned as a promising framework, so that's a keyword. The rest of the text talks about challenges in FL, but the user wants only the conceptual ones. Also, the simulations show the ASFV solution's benefits, but those are technical details and not keywords.\n\nI should make sure not to include any specific terms. Let me check again. The text mentions \"non-iid data\" but that's a technical term. So, the final output should list VEI, FL, SL as the conceptual keywords. That should cover it.\n</think>\n\n### Step-by-Step Keyword Extraction Plan  \n\n#### **Input:**  \n- Academic text: *\"Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model weights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge–cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an adaptive split FL scheme for VEC (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on nonindependent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles’ mobility.\"*  \n\n#### **Output:**  \n- **Conceptual / Thematic Keywords:**  \n  - Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI)  \n  - Federated learning (FL)  \n  - Split learning (SL)  \n  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)  \n  - Edge–cloud (EC)  \n  - Mobile vehicle selection  \n  - Resource allocation  \n\n#### **Explanation:**  \n- **Conceptual Keywords:** These are high-level terms that define research fields, paradigms, or broad areas. The text highlights VEI, FL, SL, and their applications in VEC, which are central to the field.  \n- **Specific Keywords:** These are technical terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"stragglers\" that should be ignored.  \n\nThis plan ensures only high-level, thematic keywords are extracted, aligning with the goal of analyzing academic text for conference keyword extraction.",

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, \"VEI\" is a conference topic, so it should pass. Then \"Federated learning\" is a well-known technology, so that's a candidate. Next, \"split learning\" is a framework, so that's a candidate. Then \"adaptive split FL\" is part of the ASFV, which is a conference-level topic. Also, \"nonindependent and identically distributed data\" is a detail, so it's a paper-level term. But wait, the test is if it's a conference or paper. Since it's a simulation on such data, it's a paper detail, so it should be excluded. Similarly, \"training latency\" is a detail, so it's a paper term. \"Model weight privacy leakage\" is a technical term, but it's part of the SL framework, so it's a paper-level term. So the only ones that pass are VEI, FL, SL, and the ASFV. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any. Yes, those four terms.

      "plan": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to develop a step-by-step plan to identify conference topics of interest based on the given content. The content is about the IPDPS 2026 conference, which is an IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium. The user provided a detailed description of the conference, including categories, when, where, and other details.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the information given. The main points are the conference's name, date, location, and categories. The categories mentioned are HPC, parallel computing, distributed computing, and several other topics. The user also provided a list of related resources, which might be helpful for further research.\n\nThe user's task is to extract key information and then develop a plan. So, first step is to identify the main categories and key details. Then, structure the plan around those elements. Let me start by listing the key information from the content.\n\nThe conference is called IPDPS 2026, which is the 40th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium. The date is May 25-29, 2026, and the location is New Orleans, USA. The abstract registration deadline is October 9, 2025. The submission deadline is October 9, 2025.

For example, under HPC, include subtopics like algorithms, applications, architecture, etc. Then, for each subtopic, provide a brief description. Also, include the dates and deadlines for each part of the conference. Finally, mention the related resources provided.\n\nWait, the user mentioned extracting key information first. So first, list the main categories and their descriptions. Then, structure the plan around those categories. Make sure to mention the dates and deadlines as part of the plan. Also, note that the user is a Researcher, so the plan should be for identifying topics, then structuring them into a plan. Maybe include steps like: 1. Identify main topics, 2. Break down each topic into subtopics, 3. Include dates and deadlines, 4. Mention related resources.\n\nI need to make sure that each step is clear and that the plan is comprehensive. Also, check if there are any other details that need to be included, like the specific areas mentioned in the content. For example, the ML/AI track is part of the topics, so that's important. Also, the call for papers includes various areas, so those should be covered.\n\nPutting it all together, the plan should first list the main categories, then for each, break down into subtopics, include dates and deadlines, and mention related resources.

  "summary": "Recently, numerous deep learning-based methodologies have been applied to the domain of traffic flow forecasting, showcasing a significant enhancement in predictive accuracy when compared to the conventional statistical approaches. However, a critical reexamination of traffic flow prediction from the perspective of regional traffic diversity reveals that prevailing spatio-temporal traffic networks tend to neglect the heterogeneity of urban traffic patterns. The spatio-temporal correlations within urban regions intricately links to regional characteristic data (such as points of interests,i.e., POIs and road network density), which in turn influence the variations in traffic flow across diverse urban areas. In light of this, we propose a meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network (MGSTA). Different from the mainstream sptio-temporal traffic network that iteratively optimize the model parameters by gradient descent after their generation. The parameters of the proposed spatio-temporal module are generated by a series of meta-learning layers, which are specifically designed for learning these meta characteristic data. Experiments on multiple datasets have proved the superior performance of the proposed model and the substantial improvements brought by this new idea to the spatio-temporal feature learning capabilities of the traffic prediction model.",

They want high-level terms that define a field, like \"Distributed Systems\" or \"Federated Learning.\" Then, specific terms like \"non-iid data\" or \"Adam optimizer\" should be ignored.\n\nLooking at the paper summary, the main points are about deep learning in traffic flow forecasting, the problem of regional diversity, and the proposed MGSTA model. So, I need to identify the high-level terms here. \n\nFirst, \"deep learning-based methodologies\" is a high-level term. Then, \"traffic flow forecasting\" is another. The problem is \"regional traffic diversity\" and \"spatio-temporal correlation.\" The model is \"meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network.\" Wait, the user mentioned to exclude specific keywords, so \"non-iid data\" and \"stragglers\" are specific. But in the text, they mention \"non-iid data\" as a specific term. So I need to check if those are to be excluded. The user's instruction says to ignore specific/technical keywords, so those should be omitted.\n\nSo the final output should list only the conceptual keywords.

However, a critical reexamination of traffic flow prediction from the perspective of regional traffic diversity reveals that prevailing spatio-temporal traffic networks tend to neglect the heterogeneity of urban traffic patterns. The spatio-temporal correlations within urban regions intricately links to regional characteristic data (such as points of interests, i.e., POIs and road network density), which in turn influence the variations in traffic flow across diverse urban areas. In light of this, we propose a meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network (MGSTA). Different from the mainstream sptio-temporal traffic network that iteratively optimize the model parameters by gradient descent after their generation. The parameters of the proposed spatio-temporal module are generated by a series of meta-learning layers, which are specifically designed for learning these meta characteristic data.\"*  \n\n#### **Output:**  \n- **Conceptual / Thematic Keywords:**  \n  1. Deep learning-based methodologies  \n  2. Traffic flow forecasting  \n  3. Regional traffic diversity  \n  4. Spatio-temporal correlation  \n  5. Meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network (MGSTA)  \n\n#### **Excluded Keywords:**  \n- Specific / Technical Keywords:  \n  - Non-iid data  \n  - Stragglers  \n  - Adam optimizer  \n  - CIFAR-10 dataset  \n\nThis plan ensures only high-level, thematic terms are extracted while ignoring specific, technical details.",

Then, \"heterogeneity of urban traffic patterns\" and \"meta-learning-based graph convolutional stacked temporal attention network (MGSTA)\" are specific to the model. Also, \"regional characteristic data\" and \"points of interest\" are part of the network structure.\n\nNow, applying the core test: is the term a conference/workshop topic or just a paper detail? For \"federated learning\", it's a conference topic, so it passes. \"Non-iid data\" is a paper detail, so it fails. \"Dynamic network environments\" is a conference topic, so it passes. \"Privacy\" is a conference topic, so it passes. \"Distributed systems\" is a conference topic, so it passes.

The content provided is the details of the CYBER 2026 conference, which is an international conference on cyber-technologies and cyber- systems. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the information given. The main points are the conference name, date, location, submission deadline, notification due, and a list of topics. The user mentioned that the content is from the conference's web page, so I should extract all relevant details.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conference name and main topics. The conference is called CYBER 2026, and the topics listed include areas like cybersecurity, blockchain, machine learning, etc. So the first step is to list all the topics mentioned.\n\nStep 2: Check the dates and location. The dates are September 27 to October 1, 2026, in Barcelona, Spain. The submission deadline is June 8, 2026, and the notification due is July 26, 2026. The final version due is August 23, 2026. These dates are important for planning.\n\nStep 3: Consider the submission deadline and due dates. The user needs to know when to submit and when to submit the extended version. Also, the event is held in a hybrid mode, which is important for participants.\n\nStep 4: Check the categories mentioned. The categories include cyber security, forensics, cyber crime, etc. So the next step is to categorize the topics into these areas.\n\nStep 5: Ensure compliance with the editorial rules. The user should check if there are any specific rules or guidelines mentioned, but from the content provided, it seems there are no specific rules beyond the ones listed in the invitation.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to extract key information. So maybe after listing the topics, the next step is to structure the information into a coherent plan. Also, the user mentioned that the content is from the conference's web page, so the plan should be based on that source.\n\nI need to make sure that all the key points are covered: conference details, topics, submission deadlines, and the categories. Also, the hybrid event mode is a detail that should be included in the plan.\n\nLet me structure this step-by-step plan. First, identify the conference details, then list the topics, check the submission deadlines, consider the event format, and ensure all relevant information is included.

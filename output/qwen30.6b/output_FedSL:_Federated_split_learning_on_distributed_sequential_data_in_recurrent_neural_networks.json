  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are privacy-preserving Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that enable training ML models over data distributed among clients without requiring direct access to their raw data. Existing FL and SL approaches work on horizontally or vertically partitioned data and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data where segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across clients. In this paper, we propose a novel federated split learning framework, FedSL, to train models on distributed sequential data. The most common ML models to train on sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since the proposed framework is privacy preserving, segments of multiple-segment sequential data cannot be shared between clients or between clients and server. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. A RNN is split into sub-networks, and each sub-network is trained on one client containing single segments of multiple-segment training sequences. During local training, the sub-networks on different clients communicate with each other to capture latent dependencies between consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data on different clients, but without sharing raw data or complete model parameters. After training local sub-networks with local sequential data segments, all clients send their sub-networks to a federated server where sub-networks are aggregated to generate a global model. The experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully trains models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds.",

  "final_decision": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a final report in Markdown format for the researcher. The user provided a list of recommended conferences with their details. Let me start by organizing the information.\n\nFirst, the report should have a title. Maybe something like \"Recommended Conferences for Cyber-Related Research\". Then, each conference needs an acronym, name, deadline, location, and a WikiCFP link. The user also mentioned including the conference topics and additional info.\n\nLooking at the data, there are three conferences. For CYBER 2026, the date is from September to October, location in Barcelona, Spain. The topics are cyber security, forensics, cyber crime, and cyber systems. The link is provided, so I need to include that. The additional info has a snippet and title.\n\nFor the CCGrid 2026, the date is May to May, location Sydney, Australia. The topics are empty, so maybe mention that it's a symposium but no specific topics. The link is there, and the title is given. Then, PDP 2026 has a date from March to March, location in Romania, topics in parallel computing, distributed computing, AI, and cloud computing. The link is provided, and the title is given.\n\nI need to structure each section clearly. Start with the title, then each conference with their details. Make sure to use the correct markdown syntax, like using bold for the title, and proper formatting. Check for any typos and ensure all links are correctly formatted. Also, ensure that the date ranges are correctly formatted in the report. Finally, wrap up the report with a conclusion that summarizes the recommendations.\n</think>\n\n```markdown\n# Recommended Conferences for Cyber-Related Research\n\n## Cyber 2026  \n**Acronym**: CYBER 2026  \n**Date**: Sep 27, 2026 - Oct 1, 2026  \n**Location**: Barcelona, Spain  \n**Conference Topics**:  \n- Cyber security  \n- Forensics  \n- Cyber crime  \n- Cyber systems  \n\n**WikiCFP Link**: [http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=190218&copyownerid=83510](http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=190218&copyownerid=83510)  \n\n---\n\n## CCGrid 2026  \n**Acronym**: CCGrid 2026  \n**Date**: May 18, 2026 - May 21, 2026  \n**Location**: Sydney, Australia  \n**Conference Topics**: []  \n\n**WikiCFP Link**: [http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=189781&copyownerid=195075](http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=189781&copyownerid=195075)  \n\n**Additional Info**:  \n- **Snippet**: The IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Internet Computing (CCGrid) is the premier forum for disseminating the latest advances in distributed systems, cloud computing, systems for AI/ML, and future computing paradigms.  \n- **Title**: CCGrid 2026: The 26th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud...  \n\n---\n\n## PDP 2026  \n**Acronym**: PDP 2026  \n**Date**: March 25, 2026 - March 27, 2026  \n**Location**: Cluj-Napoca, Romania  \n**Conference Topics**:  \n- Parallel computing  \n- Distributed computing  \n- Artificial intelligence  \n- Cloud computing  \n\n**WikiCFP Link**: [http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=188853&copyownerid=179598](http://www.wikicfp.com//cfp/servlet/event/showcfp?eventid=188853&copyownerid=179598)  \n\n**Additional Info**:  \n- **Snippet**: Jun 17, 2025 · How to evaluate B站 UP official \"Chang Hui\" as a统战 (统战) member?  \n- **Title**: PDP 2026: Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing  \n```",

  "summary": "The advent of the Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things (AIoT) has sparked a revolution in the deployment of intelligent systems, driving the need for innovative data processing techniques. Due to escalating data privacy concerns and the immense volume of data produced by IoT devices, decentralized and distributed learning methods that are rapidly replacing traditional centralized learning play a pivotal role. As AIoT systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the accompanying computational and storage demands necessitate a departure from conventional paradigms towards more scalable, distributed, and decentralized architectures. This paper delves into the background of AIoT, with a particular focus on the evolution of distributed and decentralized learning mechanisms that operate without the need for centralized data collection, thus aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for enhanced data privacy. The various distributed and decentralized learning strategies are the focus of this paper that facilitate collaborative model training across multiple AIoT nodes, thereby not only improving the performance of the AIoT system but also mitigating the risks of data concentration. The review further explores the adaptability of AI algorithms in these distributed settings, assessing their potential to optimize system performance and learning efficacy. The paper concludes with some use cases and lessons learned for decentralized and distributed learning in various AIoT areas.",

They provided a list of recommended conferences with their details, including acronyms, names, deadlines, locations, and topics. The task is to present these in a structured way.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the structure. The report should have sections like \"Recommended Conferences\" with each entry having the acronym, name, deadline, location, and the WikiCFP link. Also, there's an additional_info block with two entries, each with their own snippet, title, and link. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the additional_info is separate. So in the main list, each conference has its own additional_info. But in the example, both entries are under the same main list. So I need to structure the main list with each conference's details, and then include the additional_info as a separate section. \n\nI should check if all the required fields are present. The date, location, and link for each conference are included. The topics are listed as well. Also, the additional_info has two entries, each with their own snippet, title, and link. \n\nNow, I need to format this in Markdown. Start with the title, then the main list, and then the additional_info. Make sure to use proper markdown syntax like headings, bullet points, and links. Avoid any markdown formatting except for the required sections. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that the main list is separated by a line break, and the additional_info is within the same list. So I should follow that structure. Also, ensure that the WikiCFP links are correctly formatted with the eventid and copyownerid parameters. \n\nDouble-check the dates and locations. The date is May 18–21, 2026, and the location is Western Sydney, Australia. The additional_info entries have their own dates and links. \n\nI think that's all. Now, structure the report with the main list and the additional_info, ensuring all details are included and properly formatted.\n</think>\n\n```markdown\n# Recommended Conferences\n\n## Recommended Conferences\n\n### 26th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2026)\n\n- **Acronym**: CCGrid 2026  \n- **Name**: 26th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing  \n- **Deadline**: May 18–21, 2026  \n- **Location**: Western Sydney, Australia  \n\n**Conference Topics**:  \n- Hardware systems, architectures, and future compute platforms  \n- Software systems, applications, and programming models  \n- Sustainable computing and green technologies  \n- Performance modeling, analysis, and optimization  \n- Security, privacy, and reliability  \n- Systems for AI/ML and distributed intelligence  \n\n**Additional Info**:  \n- **CYBER 2025, The Tenth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems**  \n  - **Schedule**: September 28–October 2, 2025  \n  - **Link**: [http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=183210](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=183210)  \n\n```",

The input is the given paper summary, and the output should be a list of conceptual keywords. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core strategy mentioned. The plan should differentiate between conceptual and specific keywords. Conceptual keywords are high-level terms like \"distributed systems\" or \"decentralized learning,\" while specific ones like \"non-iid data\" are to be ignored.\n\nSo, the first step is to read the paper summary and identify the main concepts. Let me start by breaking down the summary. The paper talks about AIoT, its impact on data processing, privacy concerns, and the shift to decentralized learning. The key terms here are \"Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things,\" \"decentralized learning,\" \"distributed systems,\" \"privacy concerns,\" \"scalable architectures,\" \"collaborative model training,\" \"performance,\" \"algorithm adaptability,\" \"use cases,\" and \"lessons learned.\"\n\nNow, I need to make sure I'm not including specific technical terms.

Due to escalating data privacy concerns and the immense volume of data produced by IoT devices, decentralized and distributed learning methods that are rapidly replacing traditional centralized learning play a pivotal role. As AIoT systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the accompanying computational and storage demands necessitate a departure from conventional paradigms towards more scalable, distributed, and decentralized architectures. This paper delves into the background of AIoT, with a particular focus on the evolution of distributed and decentralized learning mechanisms that operate without the need for centralized data collection, thus aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for enhanced data privacy. The various distributed and decentralized learning strategies are the focus of this paper that facilitate collaborative model training across multiple AIoT nodes, thereby not only improving the performance of the AIoT system but also mitigating the risks of data concentration. The review further explores the adaptability of AI algorithms in these distributed settings, assessing their potential to optimize system performance and learning efficacy. The paper concludes with some use cases and lessons learned for decentralized and distributed learning in various AIoT areas.\"  \n\n#### **Output:**  \n- **Conceptual Keywords:**  \n  - **Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things (AIoT)**  \n  - **Decentralized and distributed learning**  \n  - **Scalable, distributed, and decentralized architectures**  \n  - **Collaborative model training**  \n  - **Performance and learning efficacy**  \n  - **Use cases and lessons learned**  \n  - **Privacy concerns**  \n  - **GDPR**  \n\n#### **Explanation of Strategy:**  \n1. **Read the Text:** Identify high-level terms that define research fields, paradigms, or broad areas (e.g., \"AIoT,\" \"distributed systems\").  \n2. **Filter Specific Keywords:** Exclude terms like \"non-iid data,\" \"stragglers,\" \"Adam optimizer,\" or \"CIFAR-10 dataset\" as they are technical and must be ignored.  \n3. **Analyze Thematic Keywords:** Focus on terms like \"decentralized learning,\" \"distributed systems,\" \"privacy concerns,\" and \"GDPR\" to capture the overarching themes of the paper.  \n4. **Categorize and Summarize:** Compile the extracted keywords into a concise list, ensuring clarity and relevance to the paper’s focus.",
      "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the conceptual keywords from the given academic text. The main task is to identify terms that are likely to appear in conference or workshop titles, not just in papers. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the text and identify all possible candidate terms. The text is about AIoT, data privacy, decentralized learning, and the GDPR. Let me break it down.\n\nThe first sentence mentions \"Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things (AIoT)\" which is a conference topic. So \"AIoT\" would pass the test. Then \"data processing techniques\" is part of the paper, so that's a paper-level detail and should fail. Next, \"non-iid data\" is in the paper, so that's a paper detail and fails. \"Dynamic network environments\" is a term that could be a conference title, so that passes. \"Privacy\" is a regulation, so that's a conference topic. \"Distributed systems\" is a conference topic, so that passes. \n\nWait, the example given had \"federated learning\" as a keyword. In the example, \"federated learning\" was because it's a conference topic. So applying that logic here, \"federated learning\" would be a keyword. But in the example, the user's input had \"non-iid data\" which failed. So in this case, the candidate terms that pass are \"AIoT\", \"non-iid data\" (no, wait, in the example, \"non-iid data\" failed, so here, the correct terms would be \"AIoT\", \"dynamic network environments\", \"privacy\", \"distributed systems\". \n\nWait, the user's example had \"federated learning\" and \"non-iid data\" failed. So in this case, the correct terms are \"AIoT\", \"dynamic network environments\", \"privacy\", \"distributed systems\". So the internal list would be those four terms. Let me check again. The text mentions \"non-iid data\" in the paper, so that's a paper detail and fails. \"Dynamic network environments\" is a conference term, so passes. \"Privacy\" is a regulation, so passes. \"Distributed systems\" is a conference topic, so passes.

The content is about the CYBER 2026 conference, which is an international conference on cyber-technologies and cyber- systems. The user provided a detailed overview of the conference, including categories, submission details, and related resources.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the content to extract key information. The main points are the conference name, date, location, submission deadline, and categories. The user mentioned that the topics suggested include areas like cybersecurity trends, blockchain and machine learning, etc. So, the first step is to list all the topics mentioned in the content.\n\nWait, the user is a Researcher, so maybe they need to structure this information in a way that's easy to use for a conference matching researcher. The step-by-step plan should outline how to extract these topics. Let me break it down.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conference details. The content has the conference name, dates, location, and submission deadlines. So, the first step is to note all the key parameters.\n\nStep 2: Extract the main categories. The categories listed include cybersecurity, forensics, cybercrime, etc. So, the second step is to categorize these topics.\n\nStep 3: Determine the submission details. The submission deadline is June 8, 2026, and the extended versions will be published in IARIA journals. So, the third step is to note the submission deadline and the journals.\n\nStep 4: Consider the event format. The event is held in Barcelona, Spain, with a hybrid mode. So, the fourth step is to mention the location and hybrid format.\n\nStep 5: Check for any additional information. The content also includes related resources like other conferences and special issues. So, the fifth step is to note those.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for a step-by-step plan.
